# RC-Sequencer
  The purpose of the system is to switch on several electrical circuits using one RC channel. The change of state takes place according to programmed sequences. 

##### Main features:
- 4 output circuits,
- 8 programmed sequences,
- sequence selection by jumper configuration,
- maximum length of programmed sequence 15 (ATtiny24), 31 (ATtiny44), 63 (ATtiny84),
- the ability to change the sequence in both directions,
- maximum output circuit current: 1A,
- maximum voltage for output circuits: 20V.
